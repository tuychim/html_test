        <li>Fettuccine: This recipe calls for a half pound of pasta and serves four people. Fettuccine is the most classic, but you can use whichever pasta shape you prefer.</li>
        <li>Heavy cream: Though some recipes exclude heavy cream, we think it makes for the most reliable and dreamy Alfredo sauce.</li>
        <li>Chicken breasts: Sear the chicken in a skillet, then make the sauce. Any leftover browned bitson the bottom of the pan from the chicken will help to make the sauce more flavorful.</li>
        <li>Butter: We call for European-style butter here for its slightly higher fat content, but if youâ€™ve got the plain stuff on hand already, use it.</li>

    <li>Boil the pasta in a large pot of salted water. Get this going before you start cooking the chicken and you can add the dried pasta right around the same time you start cooking the chicken breast. Save a cup of the pasta water to thin the sauce if needed.</li>
    <li>Cook the chicken breasts in a combination of oil and butter for golden crispness. This is our favorite golden, crispy chicken technique. You can cover the chicken breasts with foil while you finish the sauce to keep them warm.</li>
    <li>Pasta is ready, chicken is ready, make your sauce. Once your pasta is cooked and drained, and your chicken is cooked and sliced, the actual Alfredo sauce takes just a few minutes to make in the same skillet you cooked the chicken in.</li>
    <li>Toss it all in the sauce skillet. When the sauce is nice and thick, add the pasta and a splash of pasta water and toss to coat. You can add the chicken here as well, if desired. Serve immediately.</li>
